throughput.py — standalone throughput + flow extractor (DEC-S026).

Replaces velocity.py's effort-hours-per-point model. Reads GitHub via `gh`; it
NEVER parses RETROSPECTIVES.md or any session transcript.

WHY (DEC-S026): hrs/pt needed the session transcript to subtract breaks, and the
transcript is unreachable for ~every web/Desktop session — so the headline kept
degrading to wall_clock/pt, the one number the guide forbids. Issue dates +
labels live in GitHub forever, so the signal is measurable on every repo and
reconstructable retroactively.

WHAT IT REPORTS (validated 2026-06-11 against bushel/crewbook/muster/helm)
  1. Active-weeks throughput — the headline. Two lifetime rates:
       points / calendar-weeks   (includes idle weeks = realized pace)
       points / active-weeks     (weeks with ≥1 close = intensity when shipping)
     NOT a trailing-window band. The fleet is burst-shaped — every project is a
     1–6 week sprint then done — so there is no calendar "trail" to roll over.
     A rolling band is shown only when a repo has ≥2×window weeks of history.
  2. Per phase — points, pts/issue (pointing-stability signal), calendar span in
     days, and a pts/week rate ONLY when the phase spans ≥7 days. Sub-week
     phases are flagged "burst" instead of quoting an exploding rate.
  3. PR merge latency (open→merge) — median + p85 in HOURS, a flow-health signal
     (do PRs sit unmerged?). NOT a build-effort forecast: the PR opens AFTER the
     work is done, so open→merge can't see build time and is flat across point
     sizes (validated on bushel — a 5-pointer merges as fast as a 2). Reported as
     a distribution, never summed — which also sidesteps the overlapping-window
     bug that broke DEC-S024.
  4. Per-repo and combined; --issues adds the points:N histogram.

POINTS ATTRIBUTION (load-bearing — do NOT "improve" into PR-pairing):
  - Each CLOSED issue carrying a points:N label credits N points on the ISO week
    of its OWN closedAt. PRs are NEVER counted directly for throughput.
  - An issue with no points:N label is SKIPPED, never guessed.
  - Never re-pair PR-open -> PR-merge to recover "effort": that window math is
    exactly the DEC-S024 bug. Merge latency uses each PR's OWN open→merge span
    and only reports the distribution — it never sums spans across PRs.

USAGE
  python3 throughput.py [REPO_PATH ...]          # one or more repos; default: cwd
  python3 throughput.py --window 8 ~/GitHub/bushel
  python3 throughput.py --issues ~/GitHub/bushel  # also show points:N histogram
  python3 throughput.py --fleet ~/GitHub/*        # per-repo JSON (DEC-S028 digest)
  python3 throughput.py --self-test               # offline logic check, no gh

HONEST LIMITS (by design)
  - Every rate is in ACTIVE-TIME units. The tool measures the work; YOU supply
    the calendar. A calendar date = a rate here ÷ your real availability.
  - Retroactive only as far back as the points:N labelling ritual — a project
    that predates the labels is invisible (sailbook). Throughput doesn't widen
    that blind spot, but it doesn't fix it either.
  - Even more project-shape-specific than hrs/pt. NEVER forecast a new project
    from another's numbers.
